This project is the first of a series to teach myself the pony language http://www.ponylang.org/.

The code will be posted as a solution on [Rosetta Code][1] for the [2048 problem][2].

At the time of this commit, the game is playable, but I have not yet learned
Ponylang patterns or style guides. Feel free to use the code to learn but
do not take it as an authoritative source.
